![Alfred 2 Remote Inspect Workflow](https://raw.github.com/dcalhoun/alfred-remote-inspector-workflow/master/examples/alfred-remote-inspect-workflow.png)

Inspecting a device via Safari's remote web inspector involves [a lot of clicking](https://raw.github.com/dcalhoun/alfred-remote-inspector-workflow/master/examples/safari-remote-inspect.png). On top of that, anytime you relaunch the app being inspected (e.g. â€“ rebuild a PhoneGap app utilizing a WebView), you are forced to re-inspect the remote device. This Alfred 2 workflow simplifies that process up allowing you to inspect a remote device by name, rather than navigating Safari's menus.
